This repository contains two AI-powered models designed for safe foraging and identification:

Mushroom Classification Model: Predicts whether a mushroom is poisonous or edible based on images.
Plant Classification Model: Identifies whether a plant is poisonous or edible.
Both models are tested and demonstrated through an interactive Gradio interface for seamless usability.


# AI Models for Identifying Poisonous and Edible Mushrooms & Plants

## Overview
This project features two distinct AI models designed to ensure safety and awareness when encountering wild flora.  

1. **Mushroom Identification Model**  
   - Predicts if a mushroom is poisonous or edible based on image input.  
2. **Plant Identification Model**  
   - Classifies plants as poisonous or edible using image-based predictions.  

Both models are integrated into a **Gradio** interface for real-time testing and user interaction.
